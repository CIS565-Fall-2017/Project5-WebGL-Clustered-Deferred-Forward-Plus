# Features

## 1. Clustered Forward+
* Build a data structure to keep track of how many lights are in each cluster and what their indices are.
* Render the scene using only the lights that overlap a given cluster.

</p>

Parameters:
MAX_LIGHTS_PER_CLUSTER = 1000;
NUM_LIGHTS = 500;
LIGHT_RADIUS = 3.0;

## 2. Clustered Deferred

* Reuse clustering logic from Clustered Forward+.
* Store vertex attributes in g-buffer.
* Read g-buffer in a shader to produce final output

Parameters:
MAX_LIGHTS_PER_CLUSTER = 1000;
NUM_LIGHTS = 500;
LIGHT_RADIUS = 3.0;

## 3. Effects

* Implement deferred Blinn-Phong shading (diffuse + specular) for point lights

## 4. Optimizations

* Optimized g-buffer format - reduce the number and size of g-buffers:
    * Encode normals from vec3 to vec2, and decode in deferred fragment shader.
    * Use only 2 G-buffers instead of four.
    * But encoding the normal leads to some information loss.

# Performance Analysis

## 1. Forward vs. Forward+ vs. Deferred

Parameters:
MAX_LIGHTS_PER_CLUSTER = 1000;
NUM_LIGHTS = 500;
LIGHT_RADIUS = 3.0;

It shows that Forward+ and Deferred really improve the performance. And Deferred works a little bit better than Forward+.

## 2. Pack normal vs. no pack

Parameters:
MAX_LIGHTS_PER_CLUSTER = 1000;
NUM_LIGHTS = 1500;
LIGHT_RADIUS = 3.0;

Theoratically, packing normals uses less resources and improve the overall performance obviously. Considering the hardware and the range of the input data, the influence of this optimization is limited.
